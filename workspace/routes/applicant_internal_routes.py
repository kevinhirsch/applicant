# routes/applicant_internal_routes.py
"""Stage 2.5 ENGINE -> WORKSPACE callback channel.

Today the Applicant bridge is one-directional: the front-door **workspace UI**
calls *into* the **engine** (``src/applicant_engine.py``, ``ENGINE_URL``). Stage
2.5 needs the *reverse* direction — the engine (the internal ``api`` container)
must be able to call BACK into the workspace ``applicant-ui`` app to read things
that only the front-door app knows: auto-detected interview calendar events
(lane A), deep-research runs (lane B), and Cookbook-served local models (lane C).

This module is the **shared channel + contract** for that reverse direction.
Three later lanes fill in the typed endpoints; this file only provides the
namespaced router (mounted at ``/api/applicant/internal/*``) plus a working
``ping`` and documented placeholders so the contract is concrete.

## Trust model (READ BEFORE EXTENDING)

The boundary is a **shared secret**, not the network alone. Unlike the existing
in-process loopback internal-tool path (``core.middleware.INTERNAL_TOOL_*`` in
``app.py``'s ``AuthMiddleware``), the engine calls the workspace from a *sibling
container on the private docker network*, so it is NOT loopback. This prefix is
therefore honored ONLY when:

1. ``APPLICANT_INTERNAL_TOKEN`` is configured (a strong secret shared by both
   containers via ``docker-compose.prod.yml`` + ``scripts/install.sh``). If it
   is unset, the entire prefix is DISABLED (every call -> 403). No token, no
   channel — there is no "open by default" fallback.
2. The request carries ``X-Applicant-Internal-Token`` matching that secret,
   compared with :func:`secrets.compare_digest` (constant time — no early-exit
   timing leak on the secret).

The gate lives in ``app.py``'s ``AuthMiddleware`` (a small, clearly-commented
branch keyed on this prefix) so an un-tokened request never reaches a handler.
This module ALSO re-checks the token defensively (defense in depth, and so the
router is safe to mount on a bare app in tests / if auth is disabled).

Every honored request is **owner-scoped**: the engine sets ``X-Applicant-Owner``
to the user the work is for, mirroring the impersonation attribution the loopback
internal-tool path already uses. Lanes MUST scope their reads/writes to
:func:`internal_owner` so one user's engine run can never read another user's
calendar / research / models.

## Lane contract (each lane implements its own placeholder below)

| Lane | Endpoint                                   | Returns |
|------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| A    | ``GET  /api/applicant/internal/calendar/interviews`` | auto-detected interview events for the owner |
| B    | ``POST /api/applicant/internal/research``  | deep-research run for the owner |
| C    | ``GET  /api/applicant/internal/local-models`` | Cookbook-served local models |

See ``workspace/APPLICANT_INTEGRATION.md`` ("Stage 2.5 callback channel") for the
full contract + file-ownership map so the three lanes do not collide.
