"""Publish seam for the ``notif`` channel (realtime-websocket.md, Phase 2).

The notification + pending-action services fan a downstream ``notif`` frame over
the realtime registry whenever something the user is watching changes, so the
front-door can **retire its Portal/bell poll** (keeping the poll as the fallback,
an honesty invariant — no silent dead UI).

Those services live in the ``application`` layer and MUST NOT import ``app`` (the
hexagonal import contract), so the composition root (``container.py``) injects the
callable this factory builds — a thin, layer-crossing closure over the
process-lived registry. ``notif`` is a **BE→FE** channel: this only pushes DOWN;
it never authorizes an upstream command (the review-before-submit stop-boundary is
untouched — the ``notif`` channel is upstream-denied by ``authorize_upstream``).
